 this is an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have the GJB2 gene which is one of the leading causes of hearing impairment in newborns. 
 We do that by creating a Bayesian Network of all the relevant variables which considers a family of two parents and a single child.
 Usage: python heredity.py data.csv
  where data.csv is one of the csv files in the data folder so you can choose from data/family0.csv to data/family2.csv
